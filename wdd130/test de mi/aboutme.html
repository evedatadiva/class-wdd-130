<h2>Evelin</h2>

<p>Hi to everyone!! It is nice to meet you!! My name is Evelin. I am from Peru. I like to watch movies, read books, ride a bike and walk. 
   I want to be a software development. It is second semester!!. The thing That I really like of BYU-Idaho is the way of learning and teaching. It is diferent like I experienced before. 
   The advantages that I see learning about web design are the possibilities that I can create web sites for myself. Personally I think that it is awesome. 
   I am taking this course, because months ago I created one online store for myself in Shopify. So, I felt the desire to learn more about it. 
   I hope to learn about the structure and design of the web sites, optimize SEO and be self-sufficient creating. 
<p>I am member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints since I was a child (five years old). 
    One of my favorite quotes is titled: "Sunday Will Come" by Joseph B. Wirthlin, and he said: 
    "No matter our despair, no matter our sorrow, Sunday will come. In this life or the next, Sunday will come". This quote helped me a lot in my mission 
    and helps me a lot in my life. 
    Thanks.
